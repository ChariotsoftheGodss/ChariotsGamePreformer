Hey!


This is a self project I am working on. The aim is to learn more about Python as I go!

As I work on this I will work to keep this updated. 

The core of this is and my intention is to do it all in Python. 

It is made currently cfrom CustomTinker. I also intend to integrate Flask for the handiling of Oauth. This is my current objective. This is mostly done in my free time. 


The project itself will aim to allow you to login to your Gaming Clients and see your Games + Hours played in a singular location but also individually within one application.
I will add other features as I progress such as a tracker to help players have themselves notified if they play a certain amount of hours during the day/week/month. 

Anyways, I hope you look forward to the Progress! 

Please do not use anything here without my permission.

Thanks!
